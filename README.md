# lifeinvader.com
A backup of lifeinvader.com, a promotional website hosted by Rockstar Games that was shut down in 2024.

Huge thanks to https://github.com/GreenSoupDeveloper; he is the main developer. At this point, I am just gathering information.

Also, big thank you to "MGgames100" for providing us with copies of all company websites and research to make this even possible.

Thank you to **EVERYONE** who made videos on this page or even just uploaded a picture of a post. This helped us a lot in puzzling the pieces together.

## Website: https://the-rg-archive.github.io/lifeinvader.com/

## About this project:
This website was remade on the basis of "MGgames100" copies of all company websites, Wayback Machine code, Wiki pages, and most importantly, YouTube videos exploring the website and its pages.  
This website also works on mobile like the original but still has some bugs.

## List of known domains:
All of these have been restored at this point:

## What is from Rockstar Games and what was added by us?
- All pages inside the "profile" folder are from Rockstar Games **except the example page**. It is used to show how you could create your own custom pages and for testing new features.
- Index.html is **NOT** from Rockstar Games. It is made by us to make the website more user-friendly. The original index would just load a random page.
- Login.html and Logoff.html are **NOT** from Rockstar Games but from us to enable Social Club features like profile pictures and names. The pictures have been grabbed from Social Club.
- 404.html is **NOT** from Rockstar Games. They were made for the GitHub website.
- The page404 is based on the r* one but it has a backgorund that is not from R*
- The page/custom folder is **NOT** from Rockstar Games. It contains files for the 404.html, page404.html, Logoff.html, Login.html, and Index.html.
- The "main.js" inside the "page" folder contains custom code for the 404.html, page404.html, Logoff.html, Login.html, and Index.html under line 135.

## How to remove our additions and only use Rockstar Games code:
