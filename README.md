Huge thanks to https://github.com/GreenSoupDeveloper he is the main developer at this point i am just gathering information.

Also big thank you to "MGgames100" for providing us with copy's of all company websites and research to make this even possible.

Notes:
Other folders that are not in the "profile" folder are not from Rockstar Games. They are pages we created to make the website more fun.
